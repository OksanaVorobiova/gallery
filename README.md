Hi! Here you can get familiar with my work, which was completed when learning JS in <a target="_blank" href="https://goit.global/ua/">GoIT Academy</a><br>
Pixabay API is used here. You can search any images by keyword and view them.<br>
Pagination is also done. You can try it using the "Load more" button.

Code is written in JavaScript.
